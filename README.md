# Connect Four Board Game

With this project we implemented a graphic user interface (GUI) to create a connect four game using pygame. We followed a MVC model in 
which our connect four project was the model, our code with the pygame module acted as our view, and we imported both the model and view into 
our controller where we called methods from the view and controller in a game loop. 

As a stretch goal, we can add some more visual and audio details that would make the game much more visually appealing and eye-catching.
